Pancakes are one of my favorite dishes. I drink a lot of tea and find pancakes with tea to be a perfect combination. Here I present my way of cooking  pancakes.

### Ingredients
* 2 eggs.
* 1 tablespoon of sugar.
* Pinch of salt.
* 1 cup (0.24 l) of flour.
* 1 cup (0.24 l) of milk, water works too.
* Some butter, regular cooking oil works too.

### Preparing
1. Mix the eggs, sugar and salt.
2. Add half cup of milk and mix again.
3. Start slowly pouring flour while mixing everything.
4. Add the remaining milk and mix again.

### Cooking

1. Heat up the pan and add some butter. Do not add too much and make sure the pan is not too hot, otherwise the butter will burn.
2. Once the pan is hot enough, pour some dough right in the middle of the pan and distribute it evenly throughout the pan by lifting the pan and tilting. If the dough does not distribute nicely - it is too thick. In such case add more milk to the dough and mix again.
3. Cook one side for around 2 minutes, once it gets a nice brownish color, flip the pancake.
4. Cook the other side for 2 minutes until it gets a brownish color as well. While this side is cooking, twist the pancake in circular motion with your hand.
5. Cook the subsequent pancakes with as little butter as possible. The key here is to keep twisting the pancakes, so they do not burn.
6. If the pancakes start burning even when twisting, add a tiny bit of butter.
7. Repeat until there is no more dough.

### Result

The resulting pancakes should be dry and slightly stiff, they should be quite delicious on their own at this point. Optionally smearing them with mashed bananas or any kind of berries will enhance the flavour. At this point I usually combine them with whatever sweet I can find at my home and dig in.

My name is Edvinas Daneviƒçius. I'm a developer who loves JVM and its ecosystem. I mostly write back-end applications with Java and/or Kotlin. However, from time to time I dip my nose into game development and front-end web applications as well.

I like clean, structured and tested code. Static analysis and automation tools which help me to stay on this path are my best friends.
